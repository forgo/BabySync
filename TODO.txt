// Things to be done
1. Administrative UI
2. Simulating heavy traffic (Watir?)
3. Test User data
4. Thinking of clever ways of displaying web site usage statistics
	- # of users
	- drilling to user details
	- filtering based on user details 
		(location, user type, username, date joined, blocked, ip, page on, etc)
	- real time updates when someone is logged in
		(iOS-like notifications)
	- iOS administrative access point app 
	- bar graph showing main access points "pages" which are actively being 
		used or viewed
	- ways to take actions on users/IP quickly in detail or list view
	- popup views vs active view vs login view
	- killswitch feature checkboxes
	- database access details
	- console-like but smart logging
